If you follow the Microsoft development community at all, you’ve most likely already heard of the new web development framework called Blazor. If you haven’t heard of it, here’s an overview from the [product site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor):

>Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.

As a developer who’s spent most of their career working on the back-end side of .NET applications writing C# code, this is certainly appealing. I’ve always wanted to build a personal website for myself, so I took the time to do so using Blazor and found that it was very simple and the code needed is rather minimal. This post will describe, at a high-level, what you need to build out a similar application.

The source code being referenced throughout can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/t-j-c/tay-co). *Note that, as of writing this, the project is still in development.*

## Setting up the project

As you may already know, Blazor is built on top of the open-source .NET Core SDK/runtime. So I’d suggest making sure you have the latest versions of:

* [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) (you’ll need ≥ v3.1.0),

* and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

With those, we can now [create the project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/get-started?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio). When creating a new project in Visual Studio, you should now have an option for a Blazor App:

After selecting this and providing the name and location of the project, you should be presented with the following options:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*37ountuC_taVC05ZQ9_p1g.png)

These options represent the two [hosting models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-3.1) available in Blazor. We’re going to be using the WebAssembly model, since this will allow us to serve the application (yes, the entire .NET/C# application) in the browser statically. *Note that Blazor WebAssembly is currently in preview (as of April 17, 2020).*

Upon creating the project, a default Blazor application will be generated for you. You should be able to build/run this and see a page similar to the following:

## Develop your site

The Blazor framework is relatively simple, so this shouldn’t be too complicated. Essentially, the application contains the following:

* Pages (aka Razor pages — using the `.razor` file extension) — these define the route and layout of a given page in the UI. These pages can contain HTML elements *and* C# code. In the following example, you can see the C# code defined using the `@code` block:

  ```csharp
  @page "/counter"
  
  <h1>Counter</h1>
  
  <p>Current count: @currentCount</p>
  
  <button class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>
  
  @code {
      private int currentCount = 0;
  
      private void IncrementCount()
      {
          currentCount++;
      }
  }
  ```

* Components — these are used to encapsulate some piece of UI and it’s functionality. These generally take shape as some sort of reusable form or control. Using Components can be a great way to add extensibility and create a simple, clean application. A Component is defined in a .razor file, and can optionally have a corresponding .cs file to contain the C# code. Below is an example of a component I created to contain a simple page header for my website:

  ```csharp
  @namespace  Tayco.Web.Components
  @inherits PageHeaderBase
  
  <MatH2>@Title</MatH2>
  
  <MatDivider />
  <br />
  ```
  ```csharp
  using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;
  
  namespace Tayco.Web.Components
  {
      public class PageHeaderBase : ComponentBase
      {
          [Parameter]
          public string Title { get; set; }
      }
  }
  ```

Given that, you can now clean up the default pages generated by the template (`Pages\Counter.razor` and `Pages\FetchData.razor`) and add your own. I currently only have two pages, an About Me page and a Blogs page which I’ll be updating later on to contain the blogs I’ve published.

## Further considerations

If you happen to follow along and create a similar site, here are some other points to consider that I came across while developing this:

1. Since there is no server hosting your .NET code in the Blazor WebAssembly hosting model, your browser needs to download the necessary DLLs to run the code. This results in a relatively large payload to load the site (my small site comes to just under 6MB). It also means that the DLLs are accessible to anyone who accesses your site. If either of these are a concern for you, you may want to consider the [Blazor Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-3.1#blazor-server) hosting model.

1. There are already a ton of third-party libraries that you can use to simplify/extend your Blazor app. Id suggest taking a look at the [Awesome Blazor](https://github.com/AdrienTorris/awesome-blazor) GitHub repo which contains a growing list of resources. I ended up using the [MatBlazor](https://github.com/SamProf/MatBlazor) library, which provides a ton of easy-to-use Material Design components.

1. I lightly grazed over the actual functionality in Blazor in this post. There is a lot more available, so I’d strongly recommend taking a look at [the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-3.1) to learn more of what’s offered.

## Summary

While my website isn’t the most elegant (I certainly don’t claim to be an expert in UI/UX), I found the whole process of working with Blazor to be very enjoyable and I’m ultimately happy with my result.

I’m excited to continue extending the functionality of my site. The following are some things that I’ve done (or are considering doing) and will likely write about in continuation of this series:

* Hosting the website in AWS

* Implementing a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
