    Since then, I've gained a passion for building clean software that scales and performs well.
    I enjoy working with highly collaborative and driven teams to deliver software efficiently and effectively.
    I've been mainly working in the Microsoft ecosystem, writing C# code in .NET Core and using the latest offerings in Azure.
