This repository contains the code for my personal website at https://tay-co.com/

The code is structured in the following directories:
- `blogs`
  - Contains: 
    - The actual contents of the blogs (written in markdown files)
    - An `index.json` file listing metadata for each blog
  - When changes in this directory are pushed to the master branch, the contents are uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket
- `src`
  - Contains all of the source code
  - When changes in this directory are pushed to the master branch, the contents are built, published, and uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket
- `test`
  - Contains relevant tests
- `.github/workflows`
  - Contains `.yml` files defining the different workflows triggered by [Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
